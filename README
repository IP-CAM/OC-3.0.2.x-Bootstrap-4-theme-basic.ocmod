2. Go to Extensions/Installer on left menu

3. Click on the upload button and upload the file opencart-bootstrap4-theme-basic.ocmod.zip
   If there are errors, make sure step 1 was completed.
   If step 1 was not completed correctly, go to Extensions/Installer and delete from history the opencart-bootstrap4-theme-basic.ocmod.zip and try again.

4. Go to System/Users/User Groups and click on Administrators (and/or other groups needing permissions for Bootstrap 4 Theme Basic).

8. On the same page click on the Edit button as we need to enable the theme.

10. Click on System/Settings in the left menu.

11. Click on Your Store (default) (or your main store that you want to apply the theme to.)

12. On the General tab under Theme select Bootstrap4 Basic Theme and click save.

13. Go to your store and it should be in Bootstrap 4 ;-)

14. If step 13 didn't work, go to Dashboard and click on the Gear button on the top right of this page.
    When the popup occurs, Click on both refresh buttons for Theme and SASS. 

Extra Credit:
Look at the file catalog/view/theme/bootstrap4_basic/stylesheet/_variables.scss
Go to https://bootstrap.build and create different color schemes and change the content of your bootstrap css file located in catalog/view/theme/bootstrap4_basic/template/common/header.twig
